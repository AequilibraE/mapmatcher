# MapMatcher
MapMatcher is yet another Python Package designed to map-match GPS traces onto a network.

This package is built around [AequilibraE](https://www.aequilibrae.com) adding new powerful resources to its ecosystem.

Following on the AequilibraE ethos, however, one does not need an AequilibraE model 
to use MapMatcher to map-match GPS traces to a bespoke link network.

MapMatcher was previously maintained at [this repository](https://github.com/pedrocamargo/map_matching).

## Documentation

MapMatcher documentation can be found [here](https://aequilibrae.github.io/mapmatcher/).
