MapMatcher
==========

The Python **MapMatcher** package is yet another Python package designed to 
map-match GPS traces onto a network.

The main difference between this package and other existing solutions is that it 
is built around [AequilibraE](https://www.aequilibrae.com), adding a powerful resource
to its ecosystem.

Following on the AequilibraE ethos, however, one does not need an AequilibraE model 
to use **MapMatcher** to map-match GPS traces to a bespoke link network.
